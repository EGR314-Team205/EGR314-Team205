# Appendix C - Design Ideation 

The following document outlines the team’s brainstorming process in preparation of developing an environmental product. By generating ~100 raw ideas, the team was able to assemble more complete product designs due to the sheer quality of possible ideas. Using the integrated collaborative application, Google Jamboard, the team generated a plethora of ideas and sorted those into categories. After this process, the team was able to conceptualize three designs and proceed to design vectorized drawings. This process can be seen below.

## Grouping Phase 1
The team sorted the ideas into either 1) a base idea which could be expanded upon or 2) a potential modifying attribute of a pre-existing idea.

## Grouping Phase 2
We looked at the more complete ideas and then decided as a team on the three best ideas we’d like to potentially pursue further. The team then ranked each of the peripheral attributes on a scale of 1-3 with three being the best and assigned related features (yellow) to those almost complete ideas. A handful of the three star ranked attributes were too universal and would be great components of all of the designs so those were left separate and marked accordingly as applicable to all designs. The ideas that weren’t used were grouped together and kept separate.

### Concept 1: Firefighter’s Hat

### Concept 2: Golf Assist
This is a wind speed sensor which will help golfers and other casual sports to determine directions and speed of wind. There is an LED which will show the user when the wind is at a minimal level. Within the pole under the LED, there is a temperature sensor that provides information to the golfers of the current temperature and the color of the LED will change depending on if it is cold(blue) or hot(red).  The white flags on the top are the wind direction  indicators that show the direction of the wind which is very useful information to golfers when they hit the ball.

### Concept 3: Plant Saviour
This is an automatic plant feeder with a variable temperature heat lamp. Ideally, this is for households with low sunlight. The temperature of the bulb will vary depending on the temperature outside, which will be monitored using a temperature sensor. Along with this, a humidity sensor placed into the soil will monitor humidity levels and will automatically start the motor powered pump, distributing water to the soil.
