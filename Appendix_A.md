## Meeting Coordiation
What method will you use to remind yourselves of meetings (a shared calendar?) 
    A reminder text for each other about the times of the meeting.
How will your team go about changing or adding meeting times? 
    We can let each other know either during class or through discord.
What's the preferred format for meetings (face-to-face or virtually)?
    Virtually 
Are there any other procedures that your team feels are necessary? Describe them. 
    If a team member is not able to attend a team meeting, they should communicate that 


## Team Coordination 
Discord and emails will be used to communicate. The team will meet virtually over discord call and in the PRLTA 103/107 as required. Calling only be resorted to when a team member is not responding. The team has a shared folder where all the documents and files will be stored.

## Conflict Recognition and Resolution
The team will ensure all members are equally contributing to the assignments. Any minor conflicts should be communicated via a communication channel. Any major conflict should be brought to the instructor's attention and, if necessary, a mediated discussion will be held.
