## Meeting Coordiation

    What method will you use to remind yourselves of meetings (a shared calendar?) 
        A reminder text for each other about the times of the meeting.
    How will your team go about changing or adding meeting times? 
        We can let each other know either during class or through discord.
    What's the preferred format for meetings (face-to-face or virtually)?
        Virtually 
    Are there any other procedures that your team feels are necessary? Describe them. 
        If a team member is not able to attend a team meeting, they should communicate that 


## Team Coordination 
Discord and emails will be used to communicate. The team will meet virtually over discord call and in the PRLTA 103/107 as required. Calling only be resorted to when a team member is not responding. The team has a shared folder where all the documents and files will be stored.

## Conflict Recognition and Resolution
The team will ensure all members are equally contributing to the assignments. Any minor conflicts should be communicated via a communication channel. Any major conflict should be brought to the instructor's attention and, if necessary, a mediated discussion will be held.

## Use Cases

### User Story #1: Sierra

Sierra is a 19-year-old college student trying to come up with her final project topic. She decides to visit a museum because she’s always had a love for learning and exploring new things. She finds out that there is an exhibit showcasing new technologies, so she checks it out. Majoring in environmental science, she wonders if she can incorporate this into her project. Upon looking at the exhibit, she sees that there are robots designed to help with environmental issues.
Sierra has become fascinated with robot technology and how they can be incorporated into fixing environmental issues. She decides that for her project, she would like to work on designing solar panels that rotate with the sun placement.

### User Story #2: Timothy

Timothy is five years old and has just recently started kindergarten. His class is going on a field trip to the science center. Tim has never seen or played with a robot before, but since there will be an exhibit, he will get to interact with them. At the exhibit, Tim is able to turn the knobs on the robot. He realizes that if he turns it to the, the robot dispenses water to water the plants, if he turns it to the left, the water stops.
Tim learns that a robot does not just have to be a piece of metal with arms and legs - as long as it was a machine that helped people with a task. He also learns that he can “program” a robot by turning different knobs and buttons, making them change their task.

# Design Ideation 

The following document outlines the team’s brainstorming process in preparation of developing an environmental product. By generating ~100 raw ideas, the team was able to assemble more complete product designs due to the sheer quality of possible ideas. Using the integrated collaborative application, Google Jamboard, the team generated a plethora of ideas and sorted those into categories. After this process, the team was able to conceptualize three designs and proceed to design vectorized drawings. This process can be seen below.

## Initial Brainstroming Session
![Initial Brainstroming Session](/media/webpage//Initial%20Brainstorming%20Session.png "Initial Brainstroming Session")

## Grouping Phase 1
The team sorted the ideas into either 1) a base idea which could be expanded upon or 2) a potential modifying attribute of a pre-existing idea. 

![Grouping Phase 1](/media/webpage//Grouping%20Phase%201.png "Grouping Phase 1")

## Grouping Phase 2
We looked at the more complete ideas and then decided as a team on the three best ideas we’d like to potentially pursue further. The team then ranked each of the peripheral attributes on a scale of 1-3 with three being the best and assigned related features (yellow) to those almost complete ideas. A handful of the three star ranked attributes were too universal and would be great components of all of the designs so those were left separate and marked accordingly as applicable to all designs. The ideas that weren’t used were grouped together and kept separate.

## Concept Sketches 

### Concept 1: Firefighter’s Hat
![Concept 1](/media/webpage//concept1.png "Concept 1")

### Concept 2: Golf Assist
This is a wind speed sensor which will help golfers and other casual sports to determine directions and speed of wind. There is an LED which will show the user when the wind is at a minimal level. Within the pole under the LED, there is a temperature sensor that provides information to the golfers of the current temperature and the color of the LED will change depending on if it is cold(blue) or hot(red).  The white flags on the top are the wind direction  indicators that show the direction of the wind which is very useful information to golfers when they hit the ball.
![Concept 2](/media/webpage//concept2.png "Concept 2")

### Concept 3: Plant Saviour
This is an automatic plant feeder with a variable temperature heat lamp. Ideally, this is for households with low sunlight. The temperature of the bulb will vary depending on the temperature outside, which will be monitored using a temperature sensor. Along with this, a humidity sensor placed into the soil will monitor humidity levels and will automatically start the motor powered pump, distributing water to the soil.
