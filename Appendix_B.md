## Use Cases

### User Story #1: Sierra

Sierra is a 19-year-old college student trying to come up with her final project topic. She decides to visit a museum because she’s always had a love for learning and exploring new things. She finds out that there is an exhibit showcasing new technologies, so she checks it out. Majoring in environmental science, she wonders if she can incorporate this into her project. Upon looking at the exhibit, she sees that there are robots designed to help with environmental issues.
Sierra has become fascinated with robot technology and how they can be incorporated into fixing environmental issues. She decides that for her project, she would like to work on designing solar panels that rotate with the sun placement.

### User Story #2: Timothy

Timothy is five years old and has just recently started kindergarten. His class is going on a field trip to the science center. Tim has never seen or played with a robot before, but since there will be an exhibit, he will get to interact with them. At the exhibit, Tim is able to turn the knobs on the robot. He realizes that if he turns it to the, the robot dispenses water to water the plants, if he turns it to the left, the water stops.
Tim learns that a robot does not just have to be a piece of metal with arms and legs - as long as it was a machine that helped people with a task. He also learns that he can “program” a robot by turning different knobs and buttons, making them change their task.
